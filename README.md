# MyPortfolioWebsite
A modern and responsive personal portfolio website built with React and Bootstrap. It showcases my projects, skills, education, goals, and includes an animated hero section, smooth scroll effects with AOS, and a contact form integrated with Formspree. Designed to highlight my front-end development expertise and freelancing profile.
